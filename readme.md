TODO List:

- Add camera controls for the user
-

- Get tensorflow.js working
- Get a basic mnist model working
- Make a way for the user to draw images
  - Have a "clear" button
  - Have draw and erase that they can toggle between
- Pass those images to the model and disply the classification result

- Create a static 3D render of the model (fixed colors, just geometry here)
- Color the model based on model weights (color + opacity?)
- Dynamically color when a image is drawn of the actual numerical values that are being passed through the model
